## 💡 Branch summary

Once the contexts are more decoupled, the next step is to make the processes start to expose and receive only [entities (POROS)](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-2.95/app/models/user/entity.rb) and no longer ActiveRecord objects.

With this approach, each context gains enhanced control over side effects, be it writing or reading. All interactions with the database/ActiveRecord are now wrapped within the repositories, ensuring a more controlled and predictable system behavior.
