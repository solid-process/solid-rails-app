## 💡 Branch summary

Introduces the solid-process gem and implements the application's first process ([User::Registration](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-0/app/models/user/registration.rb)).

It shows the low learning curve required to use gem features. Although basic, this implementation removes callbacks from the [User](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-0/app/models/user.rb) model, as the process will orchestrate all account creation within a transaction and send a confirmation email after its commit.
